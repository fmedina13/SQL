--In this SQL, I'm querying a database ("BIT_DB") with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

--First, I will take an initial preview of the data.

--#2: How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

--#3: Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
